With my index.html code, there is a container with the rows for each hour of the schedule day and there are also buttons created for the save feature.  
With the script.js code, there is a console log for the local storage items for all of the hours in the schedule and they are used with military time. 
There is also the function to check the hour of the day that the schedule is being used and display what hour of the day it is with the past, present, and future classes.
